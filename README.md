## Structure

### The `_data` directory

In the `_data` directory you will find a `resources` folder containing a lot of YAML files that contain data connected to a specific course. This is where you can add and remove courses from being displayed on the site. This is also where sidebar navigation is defined for each course.

### The `resurser` directory

In the `resurser` directory you will find a folder for each course. Each course folder contains a `index.md` file that is the main page for that course. This is also where all the course material is stored such as exercises, lectures, and other resources.
